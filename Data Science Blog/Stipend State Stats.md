##The Statistics of Student Stipends in States  
Currently I'm on track to getting my Master's in Ecology and Evolution,
with a concentration in Evolution, so my daily routine usually includes some data-science, statistics, bioinforatics, 
and commiserating with other grad students. In less than a year I'll have completed this path and have to choose
another to walk down. In my commiseration I've learned a lot about the life of a PhD student,
and becoming one of those students is something that I've had a morbid curiosity over for a few years now.

One of my biggest concerns with the life-style is the cost of living expenses. Little more than 20 thousand 
a year doesn't seem to be enough to live off of,  my cohorts seem to make it work. So, curious, I
set out to investigate.
