## Family Rivalry
My family has always been into board and card games so every time I
go home we usually play a few games, usually one more than another. Recently this was
the classic card game/yell at the guy next to you for screwing you over Uno. After several rounds,
many which went on for what felt longer the life of the Sun, I had learned one thing: I suck at Uno.

I don't know how this happens, there's really not much of a strategy you can employ, since it's pretty
reactionary. Or is it? I had a few ideas for a strategy and not nearly enough time to play it.
So I decided to make my computer do all the work.

## Making a Game
Uno is a pretty simple game when you get right down to it. It follows an easy progression of
steps and making a simulation that plays itself a few thousand times shouldn't be too hard.
When I was first learning Python a few years ago I had made Uno's blood relative, [War]() but
this time I decided to use R. **DISCLAIMER**: If you're running iterative simulations I'd recommend Python
since the syntax is a bit cleaner and it's much faster than R. I chose to use R for no other reason
than I had never made a card game simulation in it.

### The Process
Uno is a straight-forward game that can be broken down in several parts:
1) Setup (once)
2) Place matching card
3) Draw (optional)
4) Uno (optional)
5) Win (optional)

There's a few rules for how drawing works that varies between people and households and the
actual official rules. I decided to go with the house rules which are:
1) No stacking + cards
2) Draw one card if you can't match and move on
3) No points, you either win or lose
Additionally there's no real way for me to make the computer "forget" to say Uno and take +4
unless since some people are more astute about these things than others. So I assumed players
would always say "Uno" as soon as they had one card in their hand.

### The Code
Now it was just time to put these game parts into machine code.
#### Global Variables
I essentially wanted data frames to act as player hands, with a column for the 'symbol'(number, wild, or action)
and a column for the 'suit' (color). These global variables could then be put into a function
that would play a "card" in it or add another card/cards from the deck.

I also made a data frame for the "deck" (I called 'new.deck') that and "discard" that was essentially a large hand,
where the deck would be populated with all the cards, and discard would be populated with played cards
that would be put back into the deck when the deck <= 0.

#### draw()
The all important Draw() function works by using rbind to take combine two data frames. In
this case the two data frames are the hand and the deck. The 'cards' parameter takes an integer
which it will randomly pull rows from the new.deck data frame. This keeps me from having to
"shuffle" the deck every time it's put back into play.  
```R
draw <- function(cards, deck){
  if (cards > nrow(new.deck)) {
    new.deck <<- rbind(new.deck, discard[1:nrow(discard)-1,])
  } #reshuffle the discard into the drawing deck

    draw <- c(sample(nrow(new.deck), cards))
    cards.drawn <- new.deck[draw, ]
    new.deck <<- new.deck[-draw,]
    return(rbind(deck, cards.drawn))
}
```

### next.turn()
Since I wanted to keep track of players by assigning them numbers, I had to make a quick
function that would loop through 1:n restarting at 1 if i>n if the "table" was going "clockwise"
and restarting at n if i<1 if the table was "counterclockwise" (IE a reverse card was played)
```R
next.turn <- function(player){

  current.turn <- player.turn + next.player #move to next player

  if (current.turn > length(player)) {     #return to player 1
    current.turn <- 1
  }
  else if (current.turn < 1) #return to last player
  {
    current.turn <- length(player)
  }

  return(current.turn)
}
```
### setup()
Next I needed a function that would setup the table. In this case it would need to do
several things: generate a deck, deal cards (7 per player), set up a card to play that
players must follow.
```R
setup <- function(){
  player <<- list()

  #for player turn
  next.player <<- 1 #clockwise is 1, counter clockwise is -1
  player.turn <<- 1

  #generate deck
  symbol <- c(0, rep(c(1:9, 'draw', 'skip', 'reverse'), 2))
  suit <<- c('red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow')
  wild <- c(rep(c('wild', 'wild.4'),4)) %>%
    data.frame(symbol = ., suit = .)

  new.deck <<- list(symbol = symbol, suit = suit) %>%
    expand.grid(.) %>%
    rbind(., wild)

  #play pile
  discard <<- data.frame()

  target.card <<- data.frame()
  target.card <<- draw(1, target.card) #card players must follow
}
```
### check.win()
Of course something needed to tell the compuer when a player had won. Here, if the player
has less than 1 card in their hand it will change the target.card variable to 'win' and return
the winning player's number.
```R
check.win <- function(player){  
  if(nrow(player) == 0 | is.null(player)){
    target.card <<- 'win'
  return(list(player, 'YOU HAVE WON'))
  }
}
```
### play()
I needed a function to play all the other functions in a logical manner. This function essentially
takes a 'turn' for the player after a game is
setup().

A player's hand is checked (remember players are data frames) for symbols or suits
that are the same as the target.card's symbol or suit. This is only including non-wild cards
because those will be dealt differently. If it finds a match it will remove that card from
the hand and check to see if the player has won. If there isn't a match the function looks
for a wild or wild.4 card which it will then play and then change it's color to a color
in the player's hand that the next player must match. Finally, if there is no match whatsoever
the player will draw and end their turn. After each play the function checks to see if the player
has won or not.
```R
play <- function(player){
  player.hand <- data.frame()
  #find matching card
  match <- which(player$suit %in% target.card$suit & !player$symbol == 'wild' & !player$symbol == 'wild.4'
                 | player$symbol %in% target.card$symbol & !player$symbol == 'wild' & !player$symbol == 'wild') #make sure the player isn't choosing wild cards
                                                                                                                    #because the symbol never changes, check for 'wild' symbol

  wild <- which(player$symbol == 'wild' | player$symbol == 'wild.4')
  #remove matching card from hand
  if (length(match) > 0) {
    #print("match")
    chosen.card <- sample(match, 1)
    player.hand <- player[-chosen.card,]
    target.card <<- player[chosen.card,]
    discard <<- rbind(target.card, discard)

    check.win(player)

    return(list(player.hand, target.card))
  } #only use wild if it's the last possible move
  else if(length(wild) > 0){
    #print("wild")
    chosen.card <- sample(wild, 1)
    player.hand <- player[-chosen.card,]

    if (length(match) > 0) {
      non.wild.suit <- player$suit[player$suit != 'wild' &
                                     player$suit != 'wild.4']
    }
    else {
      non.wild.suit <- sample(suit, 1)
    }

    #print(non.wild.suit)

    target.card <<- data.frame(symbol = player[chosen.card,]$symbol,
                               suit = sample(non.wild.suit, 1)) #suit is randomly chosen from hand

    discard <<- rbind(target.card, discard)

    check.win(player)

    return(list(player.hand, target.card))
  }
  else {
    #print("draw")
    player.draw <- list(draw(1, player))

    check.win(player)

    return(player.draw)
  }
}

```
### game()
Finally, I just needed a function that would let n number of players take their turn in a sucessive manner, perform an action when an action card was played, and then return the winner and the turns taken when a game ended.

Intially game() sets up and deals a hand of seven cards to n players (by default it's 4 since that's my family's size). current.turn keeps track of the current player's turn, and turn count counts the total number of turns taken. Then in the while() loop players take turns and based on the current target.card (IE the card just played) and affect will happen. The while() loop breaks when the target card == 'win' and the turns taken and winner is returned as well as a print() statement congradulating the winner.
```R
game <- function(players = c(1:4)){
  setup()

  current.turn <- next.turn(players) #the next player
  turn.count <- 0 #how many turns have passed

  #deal cards
  for (i in 1:length(players)) {
    player[[i]] <- draw(7, player[i])
  }

  while (target.card[[1]] != 'win') {
    #print(next.turn(players))

    if (next.turn(players) == 2) {
      player[[next.turn(players)]] <- play(player[[next.turn(players)]])[[1]] #player using a strategy will go here
    }
    else {
      player[[next.turn(players)]] <- play(player[[next.turn(players)]])[[1]] #playing normally
    }


    #card effects
    if (target.card[1] == 'reverse') {
      next.player <<- next.player * -1 #turn counter now subtracts from current turn
    }
    else if (target.card[1] == 'skip') {
      player.turn <<- next.turn(players) #next player gets no chance to play a card
    }
    else if (target.card[1] == 'draw'){
      player[[next.turn(players)]] <- draw(2, player[[next.turn(players)]]) #next player draws +2
    }
    else if (target.card[1] == 'wild.4'){
      player[[next.turn(players)]] <- draw(4, player[[next.turn(players)]]) #next player draws +4
    }

    turn.count <- turn.count + 1 #count turns
    player.turn <<- next.turn(players)

  }
  cat(c('Player', player.turn, 'has won in', turn.count, 'turns!' ))
  if (turn.count > 1000) {
    return(c('draw', turn.count))
  }
  return(c(player.turn, turn.count))
}
```

## Closing Remarks
Making a full Uno simulation in R isn't recommended. The code was a bit clunkier than what I could have done in another language like Python, and ran slower when I ran my 1000x games forloop() in the next part. Luckily I'll be able to use baseR functions in the next part to do some analysis on some strategies
