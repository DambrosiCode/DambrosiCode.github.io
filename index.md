## Testing uno Strategies Part II: Strategies
In my last post, I made a small Uno simulation in R in the hopes of finding a play-strateegy that would allow me to crush my family. By tinkering with the code I'll pit the single strategy against 3 other players who will play in the normal fasion. I've picked out a few strategies I'd like to try.

## Testing uno Strategies Part I: The Code
My family has always been into board and card games so everytime I go home we usually play a few games, usually one more than another. Recently this was the classic card game/yell at the guy next to you for screwing you over Uno. After several rounds, many which went on for what felt longer the life of the Sun, I had learned one thing: I suck at Uno.
I don't know how this happens, there's really not much of a strategy you can employ, since it's pretty reactionary. Or is it? I had a few ideas for a strategy and not nearly enough time to play it. So I decided to make my computer do all the work

## Stipend Stats per State Part I
Nearing the end of my career in academia I have a few choices to make, namely what I want to do when I graduate The idea of pursuing a PhD and becoming a professional student is attractive, but not without its pitfalls. One of my biggest concerns is living expenses. little more than 20 grand a year hardly seems livable, however, my cohorts seem to all make it work so I deicded to take a closer look and see what average stipend looked like based on the living wage in each state.

## A Data Science Look at Country Lyrics
This July I was over a friend’s house for the Fourth. We went out for drinks, and my friend bemoned the bar’s live country singer. I’d agreed with everything she said up until the singer dusted off the classics and I found my knowing all the lyrics to Johnny’s Cash’s Ring of Fire and Kenny Rogers’s The Gambler. It was here that I had that surely declared not all country music was bad (that is unless you like all Country music, in which case forgive me), classic country seemed to be not only be good but, universally liked as much as modern is universally berated. Afterall who hasn’t tapped their toes to Elvis Presely or Dolly Parton, and of course any genre with a song like Devil Went Down to Georgia has to have some merit. So with a long weekend, my plans were set: find out what went wrong with Country music.
